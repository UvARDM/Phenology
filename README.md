# Phenology
This repository contains .csv files with phenological data of Horse Chestnut (Ausculus Hippocastanum) Trees in Amsterdam, on a gradient from the city centre to surrounding rural areas. Every year, students will monitor the onset of buds on these trees and gather climatic data of the past winter season to study trends in urban phenology.
